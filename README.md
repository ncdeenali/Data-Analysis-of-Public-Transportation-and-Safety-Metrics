# Data Analysis of Public Transportation and Safety Metrics

This repository focuses on the analysis and modeling of public transportation data from various agencies. The dataset includes detailed metrics such as transportation modes, service types, population coverage, and safety-related incidents like pedestrian and vehicle injuries.

# The project covers the following stages:

  - Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Preparing the dataset for analysis

  - Feature Selection: Utilizing statistical methods like Variance Threshold and SelectKBest to identify the most important features that influence transportation safety and        service efficiency.

  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and interpreting key patterns and trends in the transportation and safety data.

  - Neural Network Modeling: Applying a neural network model to predict injury rates and safety outcomes based on transportation data, enhancing decision-making in public           transportation management.

  - Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the neural network and other models through metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
